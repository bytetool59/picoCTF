# Insp3ct0r

## Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection:

# Breakthrough
Basically, the flag code is hidden in three parts. Each in one file. The ideia here is to make the user use the **inspect element** function in order to see each of those files.

## Flag parts
- Index.html
  > picoCTF{tru3_d3

- mycss.css
  > t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t 

- myjs.js
  > _lucky?832b0699} 

# Flag
> picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}
